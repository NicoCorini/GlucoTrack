# GlucoTrack

> Smart, structured and clinically‚Äëoriented diabetes telemonitoring platform (Academic Project ‚Äì Software Engineering AY 2024/25 ‚Äì Final Grade: Top Evaluation)

## üëÄ Quick Pitch (For Non‚ÄëTechnical Visitors)

GlucoTrack helps people with type 2 diabetes stay on track with medical recommendations. Patients log glucose readings, therapy intakes and symptoms; the system highlights risks and doctors see concise trends instead of raw noise. Everything is auditable, clinically structured and designed as a solid base for future extensions (notifications, predictive risk, device integration).

| Healthcare Need / Pain Point          | How GlucoTrack Responds                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Missed doses go unnoticed             | Structured therapy schedules + adherence tracking + alert logic               |
| Doctors lose time in raw spreadsheets | Focused dashboards & summarized trends (glycemia, adherence, alerts)          |
| Fragmented patient info               | Unified model: measurements, therapies, comorbidities, risk factors, symptoms |
| Poor traceability                     | Change logs + explicit DTO contracts + auditable state transitions            |
| Over‚Äënotification risk                | Severity mapping + scoped recipients (patient vs patient+doctor)              |

## üö© Status Snapshot

- Completed: Authentication & role management, patient clinical data domain (glycemic measurements, therapies & schedules, medication intakes, symptoms, reported conditions, risk factors, comorbidities), alert engine (manual + severity mapping), doctor dashboards & patient analytics summary, change log / audit modeling, structured DTO transport layer, initial automated monitoring module skeleton.
- Optional Extensions (Roadmap): Push notifications (FCM), offline cache & sync queue, predictive risk scoring (hypo/hyper trend detection), glucometer / wearable ingestion, ML stratification, contract test harness, advanced monitoring jobs.

---

## üî• Value Highlights

- Reduces silent non‚Äëadherence via structured intake + alert pathways.
- Encourages patient self‚Äëmanagement with clear, minimal input surfaces.
- Gives clinicians actionable (not verbose) aggregated data slices.
- Ensures accountability (audit trail + role scoping, no self‚Äëregistration).
- Production‚Äëstyle separation (controllers / DTOs / EF Core models) for maintainability & future scaling.

## üß± Architecture Overview

```
api/            ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET) ‚Äì controllers, DTOs, EF Core context
monitoring/     Background monitoring task (analytics & alert generation foundation)
app/            React Native (TypeScript) mobile client ‚Äì components, hooks, services, models
```

### Backend

- Pattern: Controllers ‚Üí (service logic layering emergent) ‚Üí EF Core DbContext.
- DTO layer isolates transport from persistence entities (versionable contract surface).
- Alert engine centralizes severity mapping + recipient resolution.
- Change log service (extensible) for auditable clinical operations.

### Mobile (React Native + TypeScript)

- `models/` typed domain & DTO interfaces.
- `services/` API orchestration (facade + singleton style for error handling / reuse).
- `hooks/` reactive behaviors (focus refresh, derived state helpers).
- `screens/` & `components/` presentational separation.

### Monitoring Module

- Separate process prepared for periodic scans: missing measurements, adherence gaps, symptom escalation, report synthesis (extensible for ML / risk scoring).

---

## üóÑ Data Model (Key Entities)

Users (Patient / Doctor / Admin), Therapies, MedicationSchedules, MedicationIntakes, GlycemicMeasurements, Symptoms, ClinicalComorbidities, RiskFactors, ReportedConditions, Alerts (+AlertTypes +AlertRecipients), ChangeLogs, PatientDoctors.

Integrity via:

- Foreign keys & referential constraints
- Dual validation (API syntactic + semantic rules)
- Non‚Äëdestructive (soft) lifecycle strategies for clinical history
- Explicit auditing of key modifications
